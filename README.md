# Dynamic-User-Permission-Assignment-System

## Project Created by :
Shantanu Nanasaheb Game Student of Amrutwahini College of Engineering T.E. Computer Engineering Department (Under Zenser Python and SQL Training)

## Project Title: Dynamic User Permission Assignment System (SQL)

## Project Description:

The Dynamic User Permission Assignment System is a SQL-based solution that dynamically manages user permissions based on roles, time-based restrictions, and other conditions. It ensures users have access only when specific criteria are met. Permissions such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE are granted or revoked using stored procedures and dynamic SQL. The system also includes logging of all permission changes for auditing purposes.

## Key Features:
Role-based Access Control: Grants permissions based on user roles.
Time-based Control: Permissions are active only during specified times.
Dynamic Permission Management: Permissions are granted/revoked based on conditions.
Audit Logging: Tracks permission changes with detailed logs.

## Technologies Used:
SQL & PL/SQL: For creating tables, stored procedures, and dynamic SQL queries.
Database Systems: Oracle, MySQL, or PostgreSQL.
Timestamps: For time-based access control.

## Guidance:
Project created under the guidance of Sir Aniruddha Gaikwad .
